Use this mapping rule when you want data from a table to be 
stored in a dedicated collection. Any database table can use a 
:guilabel:`New Documents` mapping rule.

The :guilabel:`New Documents` mapping rule is the most basic mapping rule option.
It creates a document for each row of data in your relational database.

About this Task
---------------

You can have multiple :guilabel:`New Documents` mapping rules from
different tables into the same collection. Relational Migrator treats
these tables as isolated data and the destination documents are not 
merged together in any way.  

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Select a table or collection

      a. In the left :guilabel:`Schema model` pane, click on a 
         collection under the :guilabel:`MongoDB` or 
         :guilabel:`Relational` header.
   
         This prompts the :guilabel:`Mappings` pane to open on the right of the screen.

   .. step:: Create or edit a rule

      a. From the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen, click :guilabel:`+ Add` 
         to create a new mapping rule or click the 
         :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` icon to edit an existing rule.

      b. Select :guilabel:`New documents` under :guilabel:`Migrate table as`.

   .. step:: (Optional) Configure mapping rule filters
      
      .. include:: /includes/fact-mapping-options-rule-filter.rst

   .. step:: Configure fields

      a. Define the options for the new mapping rule. When defining the 
         mapping rule, you can:

	      - Change the collection name. 
	     
	        To change the collection name, click the :guilabel:`Name` text box and enter 
	        the new name. Click outside of the text box to save the change. If the name 
	        is already in use, you receive a validation error. 

	      - Change field names.
	      - Include or exclude a field from your sync job by clicking the
	        :icon-fa5:`check-square` icon next to the field name.

   .. step:: Save and close

      a. Click :guilabel:`Save And Close`.

Example
-------

This section demonstrates the relational input and
the MongoDB output of the :guilabel:`New Documents` mapping rule.

New Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example a :guilabel:`New Documents` mapping rule is applied to a single row 
from the ``Customer`` table.


Click the tabs below to see the input and output for this example:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Relational Input
      :tabid: new-document-in

      ``Customer`` table:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Id
           - Name
           - Address1
           - Address2
           - Address3
         * - 1
           - Joelynn Fawthrop
           - 86 Dwight Pass
           - Carregal
           - 3800-854

   .. tab:: MongoDB Output
      :tabid: Embedded-array-out

      The document in the ``Customer`` collection now has all the relation
      table fields.

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         {  
            "_id": {    "CustomerID": 1  },
            "Name": "Joelynn Fawthrop",
            "Address1": "86 Dwight Pass",
            "Address2": "Carregal",
            "Address3": "3800-854"
         }
