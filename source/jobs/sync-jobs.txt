Sync jobs transfer data from your relational database to MongoDB. Sync 
jobs use project-level :ref:`rm-mapping-rules` to distribute data to 
your MongoDB database.

Types of Sync Jobs
------------------

Relational Migrator offers two different sync job types:

**Snapshot**: Snapshot sync jobs run once, typically for a point in time 
migration strategy.

**Continuous**: Continuous sync jobs cover new incoming data for a zero-downtime 
Change Data Capture (CDC) migration strategy. Continuous jobs run a snapshot stage first,
followed by a CDC stage that captures database updates in near-real time. 
When you run a continuous sync job, your source and destination database 
data remain in sync.

.. note:: Kafka Deployment Model

   The Kafka deployment model of Relational Migrator allows you to run 
   longer-running snapshot or continuous sync jobs with improved resiliency. 
   For more details about the Kafka deployment model, see 
   :ref:`kafka-intro`.

Recoverability
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-cdc-recoverable.rst

Behavior
--------

Sync jobs are non-impodent by default. Sync jobs insert new documents each 
time they are run, with the option to delete each collection at 
the start of the dialogue.

You can enable impodent inserts for documents and arrays by setting 
``migrator.engine.transform.idempotency: true`` in the ``user.properties`` file 
to automatically delete document inserts from the previous sync job. Enabling 
impodency may have substantial performance impact on large jobs.

Get Started
-----------

You can perform the following tasks from the **Data Migration** tab.
