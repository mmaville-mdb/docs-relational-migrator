Sync jobs transfer data from your relational database to MongoDB. Sync 
jobs use project-level :ref:`rm-mapping-rules` to distribute data to 
your MongoDB database.

Types of Sync Jobs
------------------

Relational Migrator offers two different sync job types:

**Snapshot**: Snapshot sync jobs run once, typically for a point in time 
migration strategy.

**Continuous**: Continuous sync jobs cover new incoming data for a zero-downtime 
Change Data Capture (CDC) migration strategy. Continuous jobs run a snapshot stage first,
followed by a CDC stage that captures database updates in near-real time. 
When you run a continuous sync job, your source and destination database 
data remain in sync.

.. note:: Kafka Deployment Model

   The Kafka deployment model of Relational Migrator allows you to run 
   longer-running snapshot or continuous sync jobs with improved resiliency. 
   For more details about the Kafka deployment model, see 
   :ref:`kafka-intro`.

Recoverability
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-cdc-recoverable.rst

Behavior
--------

Sync jobs are non-idempotent by default. Relational Migrator inserts new 
documents and embeded arrays each time a job is run, with the option to 
delete each existing collection at the start of the sync dialogue. You 
can enable idempotency to delete inserts from the previous sync job 
automatically.

To enable idempotent inserts for documents and embedded arrays, set 
``migrator.engine.transform.idempotency: true`` in the 
``user.properties`` file. Enabling idempotency may have substantial 
performance impact on large jobs.

Get Started
-----------

You can perform the following tasks from the **Data Migration** tab.
