You can select and convert one or more queries, stored procedures, 
triggers, and views in bulk by enabling the multi-select toggle. 
Bulk conversion creates a job that queues and executes each query 
conversion individually from a single request.

Copy and paste your queries into the query converter individually and 
then bulk convert a selection to update them to work with MongoDB and
your migrated schema.
