- The query converter uses AI technology which may not be able to 
  convert long or complex queries, triggers, or stored procedures. 
  Some queries may not be converted correctly while others may not 
  be converted at all.

- The query converter uses the relational schema, the MongoDB schema,  
  and the mapping rules in your current project to determine how the 
  queries should be converted. Conversions may fail or be incorrect if 
  the queries reference tables that are not in your relational schema
  or if they are not mapped to MongoDB collections.

- Converted queries, triggers, views, and stored procedures are saved in 
  your project and persist through project import and exports.

- SQL queries are limited to 40,000 text characters.
